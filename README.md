# Pythagorean Triplets - Multiprocess Brute Force

This repository contains a Python program that calculates Pythagorean triplets using a brute force approach with multiprocessing. The program utilizes multiple processes to speed up the computation of Pythagorean triplets.

## Program Overview

The program consists of the following components:

- `TicToc` class: A simple timer class that measures the execution time.
- `triplets` function: The main function responsible for calculating Pythagorean triplets within a specified range.
- `main` function: The entry point of the program that manages the multiprocessing setup and execution.

## Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pythagorean-triplets.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd Pythagorean-Triplets-multiprocces-BruteForce-
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```shell
   python pythagorean_triplets.py
   ```

   This will execute the program and display the generated Pythagorean triplets.

## Results

The program calculates Pythagorean triplets using a brute force approach and multiprocessing. It divides the computation across multiple processes, taking advantage of the available CPU cores. The program outputs the triplets it finds, the total number of triplets, the number of triplets per CPU, and the execution time.
